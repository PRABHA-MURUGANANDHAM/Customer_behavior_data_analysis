## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The dataset contains e-commerce transaction records, including:

* Customer demographics and IDs
* Product details (name, category, MRP, discount, stock status)
* Purchase quantities and prices
* Order dates and revenue metrics

> Example Table: `customer_behavior`
> Columns: `CustomerID`, `Name`, `Category`, `MRP`, `DiscountPercent`, `OutOfStock`, `Quantity`, `TotalPrice`, `OrderDate`

## üîç Steps Performed

### 1. **Data Extraction (SQL)**

* Imported dataset into **MySQL** database.
* Executed SQL queries to clean and filter data.
* Performed analysis such as:

  * Top 10 best-value products (by discount percentage)
  * Out-of-stock high-MRP items
  * Estimated revenue per category
  * Monthly sales trends

### 2. **Data Analysis (Python)**

* Connected MySQL database to Jupyter Notebook using `SQLAlchemy` and `PyMySQL`.
* Performed:

  * Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates)
  * Descriptive analysis and feature engineering
  * Visualization (sales trend, top customers, product distribution)

### 3. **Data Visualization (Power BI)**

* Connected Power BI to the MySQL database.
* Designed an **interactive dashboard** showing:

  * Revenue trends and category performance
  * Customer purchase frequency
  * Product sales by discount and availability
  * Top 5 customers and top 10 products by revenue

---

## üìä Key Insights

* High discount percentages significantly boost purchase frequency.
* Electronics and fashion categories have the highest average order value.
* Certain high-MRP products are frequently out of stock, impacting sales potential.
* A small percentage of repeat customers contribute to the majority of revenue.
